The data set has COVID-19 fictional data from 3 planets: Tatooine, Naboo and Alderaan¶
For each Planet there is information for: Daily Cases, Recoveries and Deaths in this order for 4 cities

The dataset is created as lists below since file handling is not yet covered. Normally this sort of data is read into python from one or multiple files

The objective of this excercise is to teach you slicing, aggregating, plotting data in a numpy array
 Excited to share a fascinating exercise in data manipulation using Python! 🐍📊

Imagine a world where COVID-19 affects not just our own, but also three distant planets: Tatooine, Naboo, and Alderaan. 🪐 The dataset at hand captures the daily cases, recoveries, and unfortunate deaths across four cities on each planet.

Let's dive into the Python universe and showcase some powerful techniques for data analysis using numpy and matplotlib!
